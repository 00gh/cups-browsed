## CHANGES IN V2.0b2 (8th January 2023)

- cups-browsed is not part of cups-filters any more. Reflect this in
  screen messages and comments in cups-browsed.c.

- Makefile.am: Include NOTICE in distribution tarball

- configure.ac: Added "foreign" to to AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE() call. Makes
  automake not require a file named README.

- Cleaned up .gitignore

- Tons of fixes in the source code documentation: README.md, INSTALL,
  DEVELOPING.md, CONTRIBUTING.md, COPYING, NOTICE, ... Adapted to the
  libcupsfilters component, added links.


## CHANGES IN V2.0b1 (18th November 2022)

- Added multi-threaded operation, the Avahi resolver callback (which
  examines the remote printer, registers it, checks whether we want a
  local queue for it, adds it to a cluster, ...) and the
  creation/modification of a local CUPS queue is now done in separate
  threads, so that these processes can get executed in parallel to
  keep the local queues up-to-date more timely and to not overload the
  system's resources.  Thanks a lot to Mohit Mohan who did this work
  as
  [Google Summer of Code 2020 project](https://github.com/mohitmo/GSoC-2020-Documentation).

- Let the implicitclass backend use filter functions instead of
  calling filter executables.

- Build system, README.md: Require CUPS 2.2.2+. Removed now unneeded
  ./configure switches for old CUPS versions.

- Build system: Remove '-D_PPD_DEPRECATED=""' from the compiling
  command lines of the source files which use libcups. The flag is not
  supported any more for longer times already and all the PPD-related
  functions deprecated by CUPS have moved into libppd now.

- Build system: Add files in gitignore that are generated by
  "autogen.sh", "configure", and "make" (Pull request #336).

- implicitclass: Added "#include <signal.h>" (Issue #335).
